                <h3>Introduction...</h3>
                    <p>I am 19 years old. I am the first born and I have a sister younger than me.
                        I live at Dansoman with my parents.I guess that will be all for the introduction.
                        Ohh yeah wait...My favourite colour is black just because it matches everything.

                <h3>Schools I attended...</h3>
                Let's get to know the schools I attended. I attended Alpha Beta School for a short period of time and changed schools.
                I changed to St.Martin de Porres.
                They were all in Dansoman.I then attended Wesley Girls' High School and I'm now schooling in KNUST.
                I just completed level 100. I am currently studying Information Technology at school.</p>
